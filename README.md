# React Formik Application

This project is a **React-based Form Application** built to solidify the understanding of React form handling by utilizing the **Formik**. The app includes two forms: **Sign Up** and **Login**, developed using **React** and **Formik** with **TypeScript** for form handling and **Yup** for validation. The app demonstrates clean coding principles, enhanced user experience (UX), and modern web development practices.

## **Design Choices**
### 1. **Formik for Form Handling**
Formik was chosen to simplify form state management and validation. Paired with Yup, it provides a powerful, declarative way to define and enforce form validation rules.

### 2. **Password Strength Indicator**
Implemented using regular expressions to evaluate the strength of the password:
   - **Weak**: Fewer than 6 characters or no special characters.
   - **Medium**: Includes uppercase, lowercase, and numbers but lacks special characters or length.
   - **Strong**: A combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and at least 8 characters in length.

### 3. **Clean and Minimal UI**
The design focuses on simplicity and user clarity:
   - Toggle buttons for switching between Login and Sign Up.
   - Responsive layout for optimal usability across devices.
   - Semantic HTML for accessibility.

### 4. **Validation Rules**
Validation ensures:
   - Email follows a proper format.
   - Password is required and meets strength criteria.
   - User credentials are stored locally for validation during login.

### 5. **Error and Success Messaging**
The app provides clear feedback:
   - Errors for invalid email/password or missing accounts.
   - Success messages for both Login and Sign Up events.
